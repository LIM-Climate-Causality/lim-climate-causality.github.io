    "text": "Research Interests\nMy research focuses on the Indian summer monsoon and its teleconnections, particularly how Arctic amplification influences monsoon variability. I aim to uncover the underlying causal mechanisms that drive these long-range climate interactions, going beyond correlations to identify directional influences and feedback loops in the climate system. To address these questions, I apply tools from complex network science, which allow the representation of climate systems as networks of interacting components to understand emergent structures and pathways. In combination with causal inference techniques , I work to disentangle the multi-scale drivers of Indian summer monsoon and improve our ability to predict extreme events."

The main challenge in weather extremes research is that these events are by definition rare while our observational record is rather short. Besides the weather events themselves I’m also intersted in methodological developments to overcome this challenge including stistical approaches being applied to the observational record as well as specific climate simulation experiments to efficiently generate large numbers of extreme events in a given climate state."

    "text": "Research Interests\nMy research aims to understand the large-scale drivers of regional weather and climate, including extreme events, and how this knowledge can enhance predictions from subseasonal timescales to projections extending to the end of the century. I have worked extensively on stratosphere–troposphere coupling and Northern Hemisphere midlatitude climate. More recently, I have been exploring tropical teleconnections and Southern Hemisphere climate dynamics. I am particularly interested in applying causal inference and machine learning algorithms to identify key drivers and teleconnections in large climate model simulations and observational datasets. My approach integrates data-driven methods with physical understanding to improve climate prediction and interpretation. I also value interdisciplinary collaboration, particularly in connecting atmospheric sciences with ecosystem research, the social sciences, and explainable AI."
