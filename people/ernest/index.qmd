## Bio  


I am a PhD researcher with a background in physics. My academic path began in Ghana, where I completed a bachelor’s degree in physics and later worked as a teaching and research assistant. Driven by a growing interest in climate systems, I pursued a master’s in environmental physics at the University of Bremen, Germany, and gained further research experience at the Alfred-Wegener-Institute. Beyond my academic work, I enjoy going to the gym regularly to stay fit and active.

## Research Interests

My research focuses on Arctic climate change and mid-latitude linkages. I am particularly interested in understanding how changes in Arctic Sea ice influence large-scale atmospheric circulation and contribute to extremes in mid-latitude weather. By combining climate model simulations with observational and reanalysis data, I investigate the complex interactions between Arctic Sea ice loss and atmospheric blocking to improve our understanding of the broader impacts of Arctic climate change on the global climate system and enhance the predictability of climate variability.
