## Bio  

I am passionate about developing open-source climate information for locally-led adaptation decision-making by combining data-driven and physics-based methods to study dynamical drivers of change in the climate system, and by developing open-source software. With a background in Mathematical Physics (MSc) and Environmental Change and Management (MSc), I gained I worked in climate finance for three years, assessing the alignment of the financial markets in major European economies with climate mitigation targets, and on adaptation finance as part of the Mercator Fellowship on International Affairs. Aside from work, I enjoy dancing, reading, organising scavenger hunts and spending time outdoors with friends.

## Research Interests

My research aims to understand long-range teleconnections in the climate system which can act as sources of predictability at subseasonal to seasonal timescales and can aid the dynamical interpretation of future changes. While these teleconnections are often misrepresented in physical models of the climate system, existing statistical and machine learning methods struggle to identify teleconnection signals from reanalysis data that are robust and extrapolate under climate change. Causal models can address the former issue, but so far have limited ability to jointly identify optimal and causally related reduced representation of the relevant high-dimensional processes. My research so far has explored the use of generative machine learning methods to identify physically robust dynamical drivers of extreme precipitation over Morocco. My current work focuses on extending these approaches to develop machine learning methods to jointly learn reduced representations of high-dimensional climatic processes along with their causal relationships. My PhD is supervised by Marlene Kretschmer and Ted Shepherd, and based at the University of Reading.

I co-developed the open-source Python package ibicus for the bias adjustment of climate models and am interested in understanding values that shape the way we do science. I also coordinate the Early Career Researcher Group in the 'My Climate Risk' Lighthouse Activity of the World Climate Research Program - reach out if you are interested to learn more.
