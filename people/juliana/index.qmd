## Bio  

I recently completed an Honours degree in Earth Sciences, where my thesis focused on rapid transitions, or ‘whiplashes’, between heatwaves and extreme rainfall as temporally compounding events. I’m interested in climate and weather events that are ecologically and societally meaningful, and in attribution as a way to understand human influence on these. After initially studying a combination of ecology, chemistry, and maths, I was drawn to climate science for the way it brings together these interests whilst addressing some of the most topical real-world issues.

## Research Interests

My research currently focuses on using attribution methods to understand how human-induced climate change affects extreme rainfall over Central Europe, and what these events may look like in the future.
