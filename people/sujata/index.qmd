## Bio  

I am a Civil Engineer with a master's in water resources engineering from the Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) Gandhinagar. Currently, I am pursuing my doctoral research at Dept. Of Hydrology, IIT Roorkee and am a DAAD visiting scholar at Climate Causality Group. My research focuses on the Indian summer monsoon, with a particular interest in understanding and quantifying polar-tropical teleconnection patterns to improve the predictability of monsoon variability and its extremes.

## Research Interests

My research focuses on the Indian summer monsoon and its teleconnections, particularly how Arctic amplification influences monsoon variability. I aim to uncover the underlying causal mechanisms that drive these long-range climate interactions, going beyond correlations to identify directional influences and feedback loops in the climate system.
 To address these questions, I apply tools from complex network science, which allow the representation of climate systems as networks of interacting components to understand emergent structures and pathways. In combination with causal inference techniques , I work to disentangle the multi-scale drivers of Indian summer monsoon and improve our ability to predict extreme events.
