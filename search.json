    "text": "Software packages\n\nibicus: an open-source Python packages for the comparison and evaluation of bias adjustment methods\nStatistical bias adjustment is commonly applied to climate models before using their results in impact studies. However, different methods based on a distributional mapping between observational and model data can change the simulated trends as well as the spatiotemporal and inter-variable consistency of the model, and are prone to misuse if not evaluated thoroughly. To address the practical issues impeding this, we introduce ibicus, an open-source Python package for the implementation of eight different peer-reviewed and widely used bias adjustment methods in a common framework and their comprehensive evaluation. The evaluation framework introduced in ibicus allows the user to analyse changes to the marginal, spatiotemporal and inter-variable structure of user-defined climate indices and distributional properties as well as any alteration of the climate change trend simulated in the model. The package was developed by Fiona Spuler and Jakob Wessel in collaboration with ECMWF.\n\nDocumentation\nGithub\nPyPI - pip install ibicus\nPaper\n\n\n\nStoryPy: A Python-based package to compute climate storylines\nDynamical storylines explore qualitatively different changes in climate driven by forced responses in large-scale remote drivers, such as Arctic Amplification. Our project aims to make this advanced methodology accessible to a broader audience through a user-friendly Python package and an intuitive interface. Our package, termed StoryPy, provides a set of functions to analyze multi-model ensembles by focusing on the identification of dynamical storylines. With customizable options for selecting remote drivers, target seasons, and climate variables or climatic-impact drivers, the StoryPy provides flexibility and adaptability for various research and policy applications. This package is currently in development, led by Richard Alawode."

Photo: Franck Dubray/Ouest-France\n\n\nEach year, extreme weather events -from heatwaves, droughts, to heavy precipitation and storms- impact people and ecosystems around the world. At a local level, these events represent rare and unusual climatic conditions to which communities are not well adapted. As the climate warms, the frequency and intensity of of such events are changing, making it essential to understand how extremes are evolving and what we can expect in the future.\nThe main challenge when studying weather extremes is that these events are rare per definition and only few of them are recorded in observations, making it hard to study processes, spatio-temporal changes and statistics related to those events. Climate models are a key tool to address this challenge. By simulating many possible versions of the climate, they generate large numbers of extreme events for analysis. However, models have limitations -especially at regional scales- which is why a combination of models, observations, and statistical methods remain essential.\nIn our research group we study weather extremes and their changes using diverse methods and approaches. We use and develop statistical and machine learning methods to better deduce changes of weather extremes from the observational record. We also analyze and produce climate simulations including special simulation protocols to efficiently simulate many extreme events (importance sampling) and counterfactual simulations showing how the same weather events would have looked like without anthropogenic climate change (nudged storyline simulations). We are analyzing heat waves, droughts, wildfires, cold spells and dark doldrums.\nPublications:\nSippel, S., Barnes, C., Cadiou, C., Fischer, E., Kew, S., Kretschmer, M., Philip, S., Shepherd, T.

    "text": "The challenge: Ultimately, climate variability and extreme weather events affect people and ecosystems through their impacts — on human health, energy systems, agriculture, and ecological functioning. Understanding and quantifying these impacts is essential for effective adaptation and risk management. However, linking climate variability and extremes to real-world impacts is scientifically challenging. Impacts depend not only on the physical hazard, but also on vulnerability and exposure, which are often independent of climate and can be difficult to quantify. Moreover, different types of variability and extremes (e.g., duration, intensity, spatial scale) can drive different kinds of impacts. Estimating those impacts can involve both statistical approaches and process-based models, each with strengths and limitations — and both requiring careful validation against observational or empirical impact data.\nWhat we do: We investigate how climate variability and extreme events translate into impacts across a range of sectors, including: - Energy systems – supply and demand under extreme conditions - Ecosystem functioning and carbon uptake - Crop failure - Climate-biodiversity interactions To do this, we combine climate modeling, statistical and causal inference methods, and sector-specific impact models (e.g., vegetation models). This allows us to estimate and attribute impacts associated with individual extreme events or broader patterns of climate variability. For example, we use worst-case climate simulations to assess the sensitivity of European ecosystems to concurrent heatwaves and droughts, helping to anticipate risks to carbon sinks under future climate conditions.\nReferences:\nLi, N., Sippel, S., Linscheid, N., Rödenbeck, C., Winkler, A.J., Reichstein, M., Mahecha, M.D. and Bastos, A., 2024.

    "text": "The challenge: Detection and attribution (D&A) of global climate change and its drivers is well established: human influence — especially through greenhouse gas emissions — has been clearly linked to observed global warming. At large scales, we can distinguish between forced responses and internal variability, and identify the roles of different natural and anthropogenic drivers. However, major challenges remain at regional scales and for specific aspects of the climate system, such as the hydrological cycle or changes in atmospheric circulation. In these aspects, uncertainties persist — particularly when disentangling internal and forced variability or the effect of individual forcings. For example, recent trends in atmospheric circulation have led to intensified summer temperatures and heat extremes in Europe, exceeding many climate model projections. Yet it remains unclear whether these trends result from forced climate change or unforced internal variability.\nWhat we do: Our group develops and applies a range of methods — including statistical, machine learning, and causal inference techniques — to advance detection and attribution on both regional and global scales. We use models and observations to: - Improve understanding of changes in the hydrological cycle and large-scale circulation, - Separate thermodynamic changes from circulation-driven (dynamical) variability, - Refine attribution by focusing on distinct physical mechanisms, - Identify processes that contribute to uncertainty in future climate projections.\nThis integrated approach helps us to better detect the fingerprints of climate change, understand its driving mechanisms, and improve the robustness of climate projections.\nPublications:\nKretschmer, M., Zappa, G. and Shepherd, T.G., 2020.

    "text": "The figure shows a Variational Autoencoder, the machine learning model used in Spuler FR et al. 2024.\n\n\nMachine learning is the science enabling computational systems to learn how to perform tasks optimally through exposure to data, without being explicitly programmed. It can describe a broad spectrum of techniques, ranging from simple models like linear regression to complex architectures such as deep neural networks. One of the main advantages of machine learning is its ability to identify hidden patterns and relationships in large, high-dimensional datasets—patterns that may not be easily detected through traditional analysis.\nIn the Earth system, many physical processes interact across a wide range of spatial and temporal scales—often in nonlinear and unknown ways that are difficult to model explicitly. In causality and attribution research, scientists employ machine learning tools to help uncover, interpret, and quantify these interactions. Climate science often relies on large, multivariate space-time datasets, making them a natural fit for data-driven methods. With the fast-growing potential of deep learning at the upper end of the machine learning spectrum, such techniques are being applied to identify patterns and generalizations in the climate system.\nIn our Climate-Causality and -Attribution research groups, we explore the use of machine learning methods across the full spectrum—from classical linear regression to state-of-the-art deep learning methods. In climate causality research, we investigate how machine learning can help to uncover and quantify causal relationships in the atmosphere, for example to improve weather predictions on subseasonal to seasonal timescales (e.g., Bommer P. L., Kretschmer M. et al. 2024; Spuler F. R., Kretschmer M. et al. 2024). In climate attribution, machine learning can identify signals and patterns of forced climate change to uncover these in the observational record and separate them from internal climate variability (e.g., Sippel S. et al. 2020; Heinze-Deml C., Sippel S. et al. 2021).\nPublications:\nBommer, P.

    "text": "Causal data science offers powerful tools to better understand the drivers of regional climate variability and extreme events. Moving beyond correlation, causal approaches help identify the mechanisms that underlie complex climate processes—an essential step toward more robust and interpretable insights. Our work integrates methods from causal inference, causal discovery, and causal representation learning to investigate cause-effect relationships in climate data.\nCausal inference techniques estimate the influence of specific drivers while accounting for confounding factors. We apply this to disentangle the roles of multiple teleconnections (e.g. ENSO, MJO) and to better understand their individual and combined contributions to regional climate impacts and extremes. These causal tools are particularly well-suited to identifying how such patterns propagate through the climate system.\nWith causal discovery, we can further uncover potential causal structures directly from observational data, revealing interactions that may not be captured in purely correlation-based approaches.\nA newer and rapidly developing area of our research is causal representation learning, which enables us to learn structured, low-dimensional representations of climate patterns directly from high-dimensional gridded data. By integrating causal reasoning with machine learning, this approach helps isolate key modes of variability and improves the interpretability of complex datasets. Together, these methods form a growing toolkit for tackling pressing questions in climate science. While challenges remain, causal data science holds strong potential to complement physical models and deepen our understanding of how remote climatic drivers can shape local, and regional changes.\nPublications:\nCarvalho-Oliveira, J., Di Capua, G., Borchert, L.

    "text": "Adaptation to climate change requires understanding persistent changes in regional climate characteristics -such as mean conditions, extremes, or variability- within specific geographic areas over periods of decades or more. The wide range of regional climates, time scales, and adaptation needs makes this a problem of high complexity.\nVariability and change in regional climate is in great part determined by geographical location and local processes, however, it also represents the local expression of variability and change in large-scale remote drivers (also known as teleconnections), the feedback between them and their interaction with local processes. These remote drivers are influenced by internal processes like oceanic and atmospheric variability or from external forcings, including solar variations, volcanic activity, land-use change, and anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions. Moreover, these anthropogenic forcings also drive processes at local scales. The interaction of large-scale and local processes shape regional climate patterns.\nDue to the many possible drivers of variability and change, quantifying the interplay between internal modes of decadal variability and any externally forced component is crucial in attempts to attribute causes of regional climate changes. A regional climate signal could arise purely due to some anthropogenic influence or conversely, entirely due to internal variability, but it is most likely the result of a combination of both. Decomposing these signals and their associated uncertainty is key to producing useful information at the regional scale.\nIn our research group, we focus on how variability and change in large-scale climate dynamics affect regional climates. We employ storyline approaches, weather regimes, causal inference methods and rare event algorithms to investigate multiple regions, which include Europe, southern South America, the Sahel, the Somali Peninsula, and Cape Town. Through this, we aim to better understand regional impacts of climate change and improve actionable climate information. This information is often distilled using a co-production process that integrates scientific knowledge with user context, values, and decision-making needs.\nPublications:\nF. R. Spuler, M.

I aim to uncover the underlying causal mechanisms that drive these long-range climate interactions, going beyond correlations to identify directional influences and feedback loops in the climate system. To address these questions, I apply tools from complex network science, which allow the representation of climate systems as networks of interacting components to understand emergent structures and pathways. In combination with causal inference techniques , I work to disentangle the multi-scale drivers of Indian summer monsoon and improve our ability to predict extreme events."

I have worked extensively on stratosphere–troposphere coupling and Northern Hemisphere midlatitude climate. More recently, I have been exploring tropical teleconnections and Southern Hemisphere climate dynamics. I am particularly interested in applying causal inference and machine learning algorithms to identify key drivers and teleconnections in large climate model simulations and observational datasets. My approach integrates data-driven methods with physical understanding to improve climate prediction and interpretation. I also value interdisciplinary collaboration, particularly in connecting atmospheric sciences with ecosystem research, the social sciences, and explainable AI."
