My academic path began in Ghana, where I completed a bachelor’s degree in physics and later worked as a teaching and research assistant. Driven by a growing interest in climate systems, I pursued a master’s in environmental physics at the University of Bremen, Germany, and gained further research experience at the Alfred-Wegener-Institute.

I am particularly interested in understanding how changes in Arctic Sea ice influence large-scale atmospheric circulation and contribute to extremes in mid-latitude weather. By combining climate model simulations with observational and reanalysis data, I investigate the complex interactions between Arctic Sea ice loss and atmospheric blocking to improve our understanding of the broader impacts of Arctic climate change on the global climate system and enhance the predictability of climate variability."

After completing my studies, I worked in climate finance for three years, assessing the alignment of the financial markets in major European economies with climate mitigation targets and policies, and on finance for climate adaptation as part of the Mercator Fellowship on International Affairs. In 2022, I started my PhD with Marlene Kretschmer and Ted Shepherd at the University of Reading, and am currently based at the Turing Institute in London. Aside from work, I enjoy dancing, reading, organising scavenger hunts and spending time outdoors with friends."

    "text": "Research Interests\nMy research aims to understand long-range teleconnections in the climate system which can act as sources of predictability at subseasonal to seasonal timescales and can aid the dynamical interpretation of future changes. While these teleconnections are often misrepresented in physical models of the climate system, existing statistical and machine learning methods struggle to identify teleconnection signals from reanalysis data that are robust and extrapolate under climate change. Causal models can address the former issue, but so far have limited ability to jointly identify optimal and causally related reduced representation of the relevant high-dimensional processes. My research so far has explored the use of generative machine learning methods to identify physically robust dynamical drivers of extreme precipitation over Morocco. My current work focuses on extending these approaches to develop machine learning methods to jointly learn reduced representations of high-dimensional climatic processes along with their causal relationships.\nI am also passionate about developing open-source climate information for locally-led adaptation decision-making and co-developed an open-source Python package for the bias adjustment of climate models. I also coordinate the Early Career Researcher Group in the ‘My Climate Risk’ Lighthouse Activity of the World Climate Research Program - reach out if you are interested to learn more!"

    "text": "Research Interests\nMy research aims to understand the large-scale drivers of regional weather and climate, including extreme events, and how this knowledge can enhance predictions from subseasonal timescales to projections extending to the end of the century. I have worked extensively on stratosphere–troposphere coupling and Northern Hemisphere midlatitude climate. More recently, I have been exploring tropical teleconnections and Southern Hemisphere climate dynamics. I am particularly interested in applying causal inference and machine learning algorithms to identify key drivers and teleconnections in large climate model simulations and observational datasets. My approach integrates data-driven methods with physical understanding to improve climate prediction and interpretation. I also value interdisciplinary collaboration, particularly in connecting atmospheric sciences with ecosystem research, the social sciences, and explainable AI."
