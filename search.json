More recently, I have been exploring tropical teleconnections and Southern Hemisphere climate dynamics. I am particularly interested in applying causal inference and machine learning algorithms to identify key drivers and teleconnections in large climate model simulations and observational datasets. My approach integrates data-driven methods with physical understanding to improve climate prediction and interpretation. I also value interdisciplinary collaboration, particularly in connecting atmospheric sciences with ecosystem research, the social sciences, and explainable AI."

I aim to uncover the underlying causal mechanisms that drive these long-range climate interactions, going beyond correlations to identify directional influences and feedback loops in the climate system. To address these questions, I apply tools from complex network science, which allow the representation of climate systems as networks of interacting components to understand emergent structures and pathways. In combination with causal inference techniques , I work to disentangle the multi-scale drivers of Indian summer monsoon and improve our ability to predict extreme events."
